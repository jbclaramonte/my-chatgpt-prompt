Notes about this prompt: 
- when generating code chatGPT will use $$$kotlin instead of the standard ```kotlin ... ``` so you need after to replace using this regex for example:
^\$\$\$kotlin\n([\s\S]+?)\n---
And replace with:
```kotlin
$1
```

- limiting each slides to 30 words seams to prevent chatGPT to write code in the slide so expand it to try.

The prompt:

I want you to create a full slide deck on this subject with at least 30 slides: "Kotlin: the basics".
Each slide should have less that 30 words.
You will use Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) to create this slide deck.
The intended result is the following format:
```python
content = """
# Slide 1

foobar

---

# Slide 2

foobar
"""
```

When writing sample code write it this way instead of the standard way:
$$$kotlin
kotlin code here

instead of:
"
```kotlin
kotlin code here
```
"
